## 📌 TDD Workflow Reminder

For each feature implementation:

1. 🔴 **Write failing test first**
   - Define expected behavior
   - Run test to confirm it fails

2. 🟢 **Implement minimal code to pass test**
   - Write just enough code
   - Run test to confirm it passes

3. 🔄 **Refactor code**
   - Improve implementation while tests pass
   - Ensure no functionality changes
   - Run tests to confirm everything still works

4. 🔁 **Repeat**
   - Move to next test case
