# Domain Model Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for domain models across all Syntelligence services. Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, this plan ensures thorough validation of domain entities, value objects, and services.

## Test Approach Fundamentals

### 1. Unit Testing Core Entities

For each domain entity:

- Test creation with valid parameters
- Test validation constraints (e.g., required fields, value ranges)
- Test business logic methods
- Test invariant enforcement
- Test state transitions
- Test equality and identity

### 2. Value Object Testing

For each value object:

- Test immutability
- Test validation rules
- Test equality comparison (value-based equality)
- Test factory methods if applicable
- Use property-based testing for comprehensive validation

### 3. Domain Service Testing

For each domain service:

- Test with mock repositories to isolate domain logic
- Test all error cases and exceptions
- Test business rules and policy enforcement
- Test coordination between multiple entities
- Use parameterized tests for complex business logic

## Service-Specific Test Plans

### Conversation Service Tests

#### Conversation Entity Tests
- Test conversation creation with valid title and user ID
- Test title update validation (non-empty titles)
- Test message addition functionality
- Test archiving/unarchiving functionality
- Test timestamp updates when modified
- Test retrieval of latest messages

#### Message Entity Tests
- Test message creation with various message types
- Test content validation
- Test type-checking properties (is_user_message, etc.)
- Test metadata management

#### ConversationService Tests
- Test conversation creation, retrieval, and update operations
- Test access control rules (user permissions)
- Test message addition to conversations
- Test pagination of message retrieval
- Test user's conversation listing with proper filters

### Artifact Service Tests

#### Artifact Entity Tests
- Test inheritance hierarchy for different artifact types
- Test creation and validation rules
- Test versioning operations
- Test metadata management
- Test state transitions

#### ArtifactService Tests
- Test creation of different artifact types
- Test transformation between artifact types
- Test version management operations
- Test template application

### Agent Service Tests

#### Agent Entity Tests
- Test agent creation and validation
- Test capability assignment and validation
- Test agent state management

#### AgentExecutionService Tests
- Test execution context setup
- Test capability invocation
- Test error handling during execution
- Test result processing

### Knowledge Service Tests

#### KnowledgeItem Entity Tests
- Test item creation and validation
- Test relationship management
- Test tagging operations

#### KnowledgeService Tests
- Test item creation and retrieval
- Test relationship management
- Test search operations
- Test graph traversal operations

### User & Project Service Tests

#### User Entity Tests
- Test user creation and validation
- Test permission management
- Test profile updates

#### Project Entity Tests
- Test project creation and validation
- Test member management
- Test resource allocation

## Test Implementation Standards

1. **Test Structure**
   - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Use descriptive test names: `test_[Feature]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]`
   - Separate test fixtures from test logic

2. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - 100% coverage of domain logic
   - All business rules validated
   - All error cases tested
   - Edge cases explicitly tested

3. **Testing Tools**
   - pytest for unit and integration tests
   - pytest-asyncio for async tests
   - pytest-cov for coverage reporting
   - hypothesis for property-based testing
   - pytest-bdd for behavior-driven tests when applicable

## Integration Test Strategy

Beyond unit tests, integration tests should verify:

1. **Repository Integration**
   - Test entity persistence and retrieval
   - Test query operations
   - Test transaction handling

2. **Domain Service Coordination**
   - Test interactions between domain services
   - Test event propagation between aggregates
   - Test complex workflows spanning multiple domain objects

## Example Test Cases

### Conversation Entity

```python
def test_Conversation_AddMessage_UpdatesTimestamp():
    # Arrange
    conversation = Conversation(title="Test Conversation", created_by=uuid4())
    original_timestamp = conversation.updated_at

    # Act
    time.sleep(0.001)  # Ensure timestamp difference
    message = Message(
        content="Hello world",
        sender_id=uuid4(),
        message_type=MessageType.USER,
        conversation_id=conversation.id
    )
    conversation.add_message(message)

    # Assert
    assert conversation.updated_at > original_timestamp
    assert message in conversation.messages
```

### ConversationService

```python
async def test_ConversationService_CreateConversation_ReturnsNewConversation():
    # Arrange
    repository = MockConversationRepository()
    service = ConversationServiceImpl(repository)
    title = "Test Conversation"
    user_id = uuid4()

    # Act
    conversation = await service.create_conversation(title, user_id)

    # Assert
    assert conversation.title == title
    assert conversation.created_by == user_id
    assert isinstance(conversation.id, UUID)
```

## Test Plan Execution

1. **Development Workflow**
   - Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
   - Run tests continuously during development
   - Review test coverage reports regularly

2. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Run all tests on every pull request
   - Block merges if tests fail
   - Generate and archive test reports
   - Track test coverage trends over time

3. **Test Maintenance**
   - Update tests when requirements change
   - Refactor tests to reduce duplication
   - Document test scenarios in relation to requirements
