# Domain Model Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing domain models across all services in the Syntelligence system. Following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, this plan ensures consistent implementation of entities, value objects, aggregates, and domain services.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Entity Implementation Standards

All domain entities should follow these standards:

- Implement as immutable dataclasses where appropriate
- Include proper type annotations and docstrings
- Define clear entity boundaries and identity
- Include domain logic within entities (behavior that should always be enforced)
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Keep entities focused on core domain concepts

### 2. Value Object Implementation

Value objects should:

- Be implemented as immutable structures (frozen dataclasses)
- Include validation logic in __post_init__ methods
- Implement equality based on attribute values, not identity
- Focus on representing concepts with no identity, only attributes

### 3. Aggregate Design Guidelines

When implementing aggregates:

- Define clear aggregate roots that control access to child entities
- Maintain invariants within aggregate boundaries
- Ensure aggregate roots handle persistence operations
- Apply consistency rules within the aggregate

### 4. Domain Services

Domain services should:

- Implement domain service interfaces using Protocol classes
- Focus on operations that don't naturally belong to any entity
- Coordinate between multiple aggregates where needed
- Contain pure domain logic without infrastructure concerns

## Implementation Plan by Service

### Conversation Service

| Component | Implementation Priority | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| Conversation entity | High | Core aggregate root |
| Message entity | High | Part of Conversation aggregate |
| ConversationService | High | Primary domain service |
| MessageType value object | Medium | Enum representing message types |

### Artifact Service

| Component | Implementation Priority | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| Artifact base entity | High | Abstract base for all artifacts |
| CognitiveArtifact entity | High | Represents initial thought artifacts |
| IntellectualArtifact entity | High | Represents refined artifacts |
| Template entity | Medium | For artifact templates |
| Version entity | Medium | For artifact versioning |
| ArtifactService | High | Primary domain service |

### Agent Service

| Component | Implementation Priority | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| Agent entity | High | Core entity for agent representation |
| AgentCapability entity | Medium | Represents what agents can do |
| AgentExecutionService | High | Handles agent execution logic |

### Knowledge Service

| Component | Implementation Priority | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| KnowledgeItem entity | High | Base for knowledge representation |
| KnowledgeRelationship entity | High | Represents connections between items |
| Tag entity | Medium | For categorizing knowledge |
| KnowledgeService | High | Primary domain service |

### User & Project Service

| Component | Implementation Priority | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| User entity | High | Represents system users |
| Project entity | High | Organizes work and resources |
| ProjectMember entity | Medium | Links users to projects with roles |
| UserService | High | Handles user operations |
| ProjectService | High | Handles project operations |

## Implementation Steps

For each domain model component:

1. Define entity/value object interfaces first
2. Write test cases based on domain behavior
3. Implement entities with proper validation
4. Implement domain services that operate on entities
5. Ensure all invariants are properly enforced
6. Review for compliance with DDD principles

## Testing Approach

- Unit test all entity behavior in isolation
- Test domain services with mock repositories
- Use property-based testing for value objects
- Test aggregate invariants thoroughly
- Validate domain rules with comprehensive test cases
